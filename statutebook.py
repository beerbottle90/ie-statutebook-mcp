"""Client for the Irish Statute Book — standard library only.

The Statute Book publishes clean, server-rendered ELI documents:

    /eli/{year}/act/{no}/enacted/en/html            whole Act
    /eli/{year}/act/{no}/section/{n}/enacted/en/html  one section

Both verified to return real text (Companies Act 2014 = 107,652 characters of
body text; its section 1 = 3,512). What it does **not** publish is a search
endpoint — ``/search`` and ``/searchresults.html`` both 404 — so search is served
from a local index built by ``crawl.py``.

Two cautions this client encodes:

* ``enacted`` is the Act **as passed**. Amendments are not applied. The Revised
  Acts collection is separate and does not cover everything, so every response
  says which version it is rather than leaving the reader to assume.
* Section-level fetching is the right default. The Companies Act 2014 runs to
  1,448 sections; pulling the whole thing to answer a question about one of them
  wastes the context it would need to answer well.
